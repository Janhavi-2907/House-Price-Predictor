Stages of Predictive Modeling:
	1. Problem Definition.
	2. Hypothesis Generation.
	3. Data Extraction/collection.
	4. Data Exploration and Transformation.
	5. Predictive Modeling.
	6. Model Deployment.

PROBLEM DEFINITION: 
	We are suppose to predict the house prices based on different attributes.

HYPOTHESIS WE ARE LOOKING AT:
	1. Size of the house.
	2. Location.
	3. Facilities.
	4. Crime rate of the locality.
	5. Availabilty (as in ready to move-in or not).

DATA EXLPORATION:
	1. Reading the data.
	2. Variable Identification.
	3. Univariate Analysis. (Bar-plots, Histograms)
	4. Bi-variate Analysis. (Scatterplots)
	5. Missing Value Treatment. (Mean, Mod, Median)
	6. Outlier Treatment.
	7. Variable Transformation.
